This codebook was sourced from https://www.football-data.co.uk/notes.txt. Everything added by me to these data is found 
below the horizontal line after the AR field.

Key to results data:

Date = Match Date (mm/dd/yy) 
Time = Time of match kick off
HomeTeam = Home Team
AwayTeam = Away Team
FTHG and HG = Full Time Home Team Goals
FTAG and AG = Full Time Away Team Goals
FTR and Res = Full Time Result (H=Home Win, D=Draw, A=Away Win)
Referee = Match Referee
HS = Home Team Shots
AS = Away Team Shots
HST = Home Team Shots on Target
AST = Away Team Shots on Target
HF = Home Team Fouls Committed
AF = Away Team Fouls Committed
HC = Home Team Corners
AC = Away Team Corners
HY = Home Team Yellow Cards
AY = Away Team Yellow Cards
HR = Home Team Red Cards
AR = Away Team Red Cards

Note also that English and Scottish yellow cards do not include the initial yellow card when a second is shown to a player converting it into a red, but this is included as a yellow (plus red) for European games.
